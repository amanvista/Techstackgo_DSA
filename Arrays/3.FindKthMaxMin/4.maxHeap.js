// Complexity
// Time Complexity:
// The loop that constructs the max heap runs in O(n), where 
// 'n' is the number of elements in the array.
// The max heap sort operation has a time complexity of O(k * log(n)), where 
// 'k' is the value of k, and 'n' is the number of elements in the array.
// Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n + k * log(n)).

// Space Complexity:
// The space complexity is O(1)
