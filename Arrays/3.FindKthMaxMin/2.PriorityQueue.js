// Time Complexity : The time complexity of the given approach is O(n * log(k)),
// where 'n' is the number of elements in the input array.
// This is because for each element in the array, you perform operations on the
// max heap (addition and potentially removal), and both of these
// operations have a time complexity of O(log(k)).

// Space Complexity : The space complexity is O(k) because the max heap
// is maintained with a maximum size of 'k'.
